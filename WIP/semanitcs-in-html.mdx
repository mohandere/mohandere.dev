# Semantics in HTML

[Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) refers to the correct interpretation of the meaning of a word or sentence.

### Why write semantical code

- **Accessibility** - Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
- **SEO** - Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings
- **Dev Experience** - Finding blocks of meaningful code & Suggests the type of data that will be populated.

> HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.

### Example

In HTML `<h1 />` element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of “a top level heading on your page”

```html
<h1>This is heading</h1>
```

VS

```html
<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 15px 0;">This is heading</span>
```
