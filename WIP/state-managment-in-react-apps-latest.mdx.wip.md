- Type of States
    - Local
    - Global
    - Client side
    - Server side
    - Url state
- State management libraries
  - State management using pure react
    - React context API
    - React hooks + context API
  - Redux
  - React Query
  - SWR
- Separating states feature/domain wise


[react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) is yet another cool library along with [swr](https://github.com/vercel/swr) to work with your app's data using http protocol.

Here are cool things i like about it

- Updating data on window focus
- Caching data in-memory even when query is inactive/Infinity amount of time
- Quries will be garbage collected
- Same query key to share data
