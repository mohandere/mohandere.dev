    - Type of states
    - local/global/client side/server side/url state etc
- Why we need global state in React apps
- Managing global state using Redux
- React Query
- State management using pure react
- React context APIs
- React hooks
    - Use state
    - use Reducer
    - Custom hook
- Separating states feature/domain wise
- Example App



[react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) is yet another cool library along with [swr](https://github.com/vercel/swr) to work with your app's data using http protocol.

Here are cool things i like about it

- Updating data on window focus
- Caching data in-memory even when query is inactive/Infinity amount of time
- Quries will be garbage collected
- Same query key to share data
