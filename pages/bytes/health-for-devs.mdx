# Health for Devs

import Image from 'next/image'

Here is the list of tips which I found helpful for poeples who sits long and works on computers(including me ðŸ˜‰).

- For preventing eye straining, use 20-20-20 rule for your eyes which is - Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
  - You can use periodic reminder apps, browsers extensions etc on your work station.
- Go out for walk periodically/take a 5-10 mins break after 40/50 mins
- Keep yourself hydrated, again set reminders to drink water, if you aren't drinking enough.

- Sit well
