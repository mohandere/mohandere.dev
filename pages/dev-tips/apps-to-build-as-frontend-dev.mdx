### 2. [Todo app](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/)

The classic To-Do application where a user can write down all the things he wants to accomplish.

### 3. Book Finder App

Create an application that will allow users to search for books by entering a query (Title, Author, etc). Display the resulting books in a list on the page with all the corresponding data.

- User can enter a search query into an input field
- User can submit the query. This will call an API that will return an array of books with the corresponding data (Title, Author, Published Date, Picture, etc)
- User can see the list of books appearing on the page

You can use the Google Books API - [https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview)
