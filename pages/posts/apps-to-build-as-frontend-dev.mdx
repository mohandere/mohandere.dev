# Complex apps to build as a front-end developer

As a developer and while working with a company, sometimes we might not get a chance to work on complex projects and as a result, we didn't get a chance to explore technologies in depth.

Not exploring technologies in depth can be a problem especially while having interviews for a new job or advancing your skills with time etc.

I've been working with small companies since I started my carrier and at some level, I felt that I've nothing new to do here, daily work seems repeating what I've already known. And that's the time when you start feeling that your job is boring and something needs to change.

Well, it's not always possible to all of us to get the chance to work on something cool, complex and latest technologies while working for a company. To stay up-to-date with technologies and trends, we must build some complex apps, games, websites, etc.

### 2. [Todo app](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/)

The classic To-Do application where a user can write down all the things he wants to accomplish.

### 3. Book Finder App

Create an application that will allow users to search for books by entering a query (Title, Author, etc). Display the resulting books in a list on the page with all the corresponding data.

- User can enter a search query into an input field
- User can submit the query. This will call an API that will return an array of books with the corresponding data (Title, Author, Published Date, Picture, etc)
- User can see the list of books appearing on the page

You can use the Google Books API - [https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview)

### 4. Your own Blog

### 5. Web page aminations
