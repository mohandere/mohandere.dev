### 8. Reddit

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) Reddit is broken up into over a million communities known as “subreddits,” each covering a different topic. I use it as my primary way of finding out what is going on in web/frontend community.

Create an account, remove all the default subreddits, go here and pick the first ones you find interesting, then you can search for the techs you’re more interested in and complete your list. Done.



Hope that was helpful on your journey.
