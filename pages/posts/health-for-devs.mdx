Here is the list of tips which i found helpful for poeples who sits long and works on computers.

- For preventing eye straining, use 20-20-20 rule for your eyes which is - Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
  - You can use periodic reminder apps, browsers extensions etc on your work station.

- Keep yourself hydrated, again set reminders to drink water, if you aren't drinking enough.

- Sit well
