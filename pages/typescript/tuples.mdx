# TypeScript 03 - Tuples

Typically an array contains zero to many objects of a
single type. TypeScript has special analysis around
arrays which contain multiple types, and where the order
in which they are indexed is important.

These are called tuples. Think of them as a way to
connect some data, but with less syntax than keyed objects.

You can create a tuple using JavaScript's array syntax:

```js
const failingResponse = ["Not Found", 404];
const passingResponse = ["{}", 200];
```

but you will need to declare its type as a tuple.

```ts
const passingResponse: [string, number] = ["{}", 200];
```

As an array, the order is not important so an item at
any index could be either a string or a number. In the
tuple the order and length are guaranteed.

```ts
if (passingResponse[1] === 200) {
  const localInfo = JSON.parse(passingResponse[0]);
  console.log(localInfo);
}
```

This means TypeScript will provide the correct types at
the right index, and even raise an error if you try to
access an object at an un-declared index.

```ts
passingResponse[2]; // Error - Tuple type '[string, number]' of length '2' has no element at index '2'.
```

A tuple can feel like a good pattern for short bits of
connected data or for fixtures.

```ts
type StaffAccount = [number, string, string, string?];

const staff: StaffAccount[] = [
  [0, "Adankwo", "adankwo.e@"],
  [1, "Kanokwan", "kanokwan.s@"],
  [2, "Aneurin", "aneurin.s@", "Supervisor"],
];
```

When you have a set of known types at the beginning of a
tuple and then an unknown length, you can use the spread
operator to indicate that it can have any length and the
extra indexes will be of a particular type:

```ts
type PayStubs = [StaffAccount, ...number[]];

const payStubs: PayStubs[] = [
  [staff[0], 250],
  [staff[1], 250, 260],
  [staff[0], 300, 300, 300],
];

const monthOnePayments = payStubs[0][1] + payStubs[1][1] + payStubs[2][1];
const monthTwoPayments = payStubs[1][2] + payStubs[2][2];
const monthThreePayments = payStubs[2][2];
```

You can use tuples to describe functions which take
an undefined number of parameters with types:

```ts
declare function calculatePayForEmployee(
  id: number,
  ...args: [...number[]]
): number;

calculatePayForEmployee(staff[0][0], payStubs[0][1]);
calculatePayForEmployee(staff[1][0], payStubs[1][1], payStubs[1][2]);
```

## More Examples

```ts
type ThreeDCoordinate = [x: number, y: number, z: number];

function add3DCoordinate(
  c1: ThreeDCoordinate,
  c2: ThreeDCoordinate
): ThreeDCoordinate {
  return [c1[0] + c2[0], c1[1] + c2[1], c1[2] + c2[2]];
}

console.log(add3DCoordinate([0, 100, 0], [10, 20, 30]));
```
