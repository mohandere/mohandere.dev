# TypeScript 02 - Type and Interface

## Type and interface

There are two main tools to declare the shape of an object: interfaces and type aliases.

```ts
type BirdType = {
  wings: 2;
};

interface BirdInterface {
  wings: 2;
}

const bird1: BirdType = { wings: 2 };
const bird2: BirdInterface = { wings: 2 };
```

it's possible to intermix their use too.

```ts
const bird3: BirdInterface = bird1;
```

They both support extending other interfaces and types.
Type aliases do this via intersection types, while
interfaces have a keyword.

```ts
type Owl = { nocturnal: true } & BirdType;
type Robin = { nocturnal: false } & BirdInterface;

interface Peacock extends BirdType {
  colourful: true;
  flies: false;
}
interface Chicken extends BirdInterface {
  colourful: false;
  flies: false;
}

let owl: Owl = { wings: 2, nocturnal: true };
let chicken: Chicken = { wings: 2, colourful: false, flies: false };
```

TS recommend you use interfaces over type
aliases. Specifically, because you will get better error
messages. TypeScript can provide terser and more focused
messages when working with interfaces.

```ts
owl = chicken; // Error - Type 'Chicken' is not assignable to type 'Owl'. Property 'nocturnal' is missing in type 'Chicken' but required in type '{ nocturnal: true; }'
chicken = owl; // Error - Type 'Owl' is missing the following properties from type 'Chicken': colourful, flies
```

One major difference between type aliases vs interfaces
are that interfaces are open and type aliases are closed.
This means you can extend an interface by declaring it
a second time.

```ts
interface Kitten {
  purrs: boolean;
}

interface Kitten {
  colour: string;
}
```

In the other case a type cannot be changed outside of its declaration.
Below code will throw an error `Duplicate identifier 'Puppy'`

```ts
type Puppy = {
  color: string;
};
type Puppy = {
  toys: number;
};
```

However for publicly exposed types, it's a better call to make them an interface.
