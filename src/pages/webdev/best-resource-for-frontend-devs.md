Before heading into any f/w/library itâ€™s much necessary to understand basics of [Web technologies](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web) and how softwares are made in Web.

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) learning curve can be hard if you start with ES5 because of its multi-paradigm nature and bugginess. I suggest to start with ES6 and above versions and them cover ES5 concepts on the way.
